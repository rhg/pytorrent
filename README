Pymission is a bittorrent library in python.
Eventually I might transition to py3k and/or cython.
A purpose is to allow a native python interface.
The other reason is for experience in:
    git
    bittorrent
    OO
    HTTP
    python
tinfo.py is a simple test script that takes 1 arg: a torrent file.
It calls bt.open_torrent on sys.argv[1] and prints the resulting object.
